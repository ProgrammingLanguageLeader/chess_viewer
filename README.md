# Chess Viewer
This is my creative assignment in course of programming languages in my university. The application requires a game written in the international notation and shows chess party turn by turn

## Getting started
You just need to install it and open _**index.html**_ in your web browser to start using the application
### Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, etc.). JavaScript must be enabled.
### Installing
You should download the project from this repo to use the application.
For example, clone it via git:
```
git clone https://github.com/ProgrammingLanguageLeader/chess_viewer
```
### Examples
You can find 2 examples of input data (games written in the international notation) in the file _**game.txt**_. For comfort load this file after clicking _**Load file**_ button.
